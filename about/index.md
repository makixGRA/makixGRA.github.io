I'm the Chief Data Scientist at [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com/), an education company for teaching data science through interactive online courses. My interests include statistics, data analysis, education, and programming in R.

I'm the co-author with Julia Silge of the tidytext package and the O'Reilly book Text Mining with R. I'm also the author of the [broom](http://github.com/dgrtwo/broom), [gganimate](http://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate), and [fuzzyjoin](http://github.com/dgrtwo/fuzzyjoin) packages, and of the e-book [Introduction to Empirical Bayes](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/).

I previously worked as a data scientist at Stack Overflow, and received a PhD in [Quantitative and Computational Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/qcbgrad/) from Princeton University.

Books
============

* [Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/): a guide to drawing insights from text using the [tidytext](http://github.com/dgrtwo/tidytext) package in R. Co-authored with Julia Silge, and published by O'Reilly in July 2017. Also available [for free online](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).
* [Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/). An e-book demonstrating the statistical method of empirical Bayes, based on the example of estimating baseball batting averages.

Software
============

* [broom](http://github.com/dgrtwo/broom): Convert messy model outputs to a tidy format, for use with tools such as [dplyr](http://github.com/hadley/dplyr) and [tidyr](http://github.com/hadley/tidyr).
* [gganimate](http://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate): Create animations within the grammar of graphics
* [fuzzyjoin](http://github.com/dgrtwo/fuzzyjoin): Join tables based on inexact matching of columns
* [tidytext](http://github.com/dgrtwo/tidytext): Analyze text using tidy packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr
* [stackr](https://github.com/dgrtwo/stackr): R package for connecting to the Stack Exchange API
